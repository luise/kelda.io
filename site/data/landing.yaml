    Kelda’s intuitive, high-level JavaScript API makes it easy to describe the systems you want to run in the cloud — that is, the virtual machines, containers, network policies, and more.

    Just pass this high-level view to Kelda’s deployment platform using the `kelda` CLI, and we take care of the nitty gritty details needed to get your system up and running in your cloud of choice.
