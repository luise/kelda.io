  headline: What is Kelda?
  subhead: Kelda is a simple way to configure, run, and manage containerized applications in the cloud.
  copy: |
    Kelda’s intuitive, high-level JavaScript API makes it easy to describe the systems you want to run in the cloud — that is, the virtual machines, containers, network policies, and more.

    Just pass this high-level view to Kelda’s deployment platform using the Kelda CLI, and we take care of the nitty gritty details needed to get your system up and running in your cloud of choice.

  triptych:
    - numberid: "01"
      headline: Infrastructure as code. Real code.
      copy: No more YAML, templating, complicated CLIs, and new domain specific languages. Code your infrastructure in a familiar JavaScript API, and take advantage of functions, objects, argument validation, and all the other good stuff you already love.
    - numberid: "02"
      headline: Hassel-free sharing.
      copy: Kelda blueprints are easily sharable with npm. Let your company experts and open source wizards write the common configuration for the applications they know the best, and simply import their blueprints like any other software library.
    - numberid: "03"
      headline: Easily compose applications.
      copy: Clearly defined blueprint APIs help you compose applications correctly with each other, making it easy to do the right thing and difficult to do it wrong.
