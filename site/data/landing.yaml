  headline: What is Kelda?
  subhead: Kelda is a simple way to configure, run, and manage containerized applications in the cloud.
  copy: |
    Kelda’s intuitive JavaScript API makes it easy to describe the systems you want to run in the cloud — that is, the virtual machines, containers, network policies, and more.

    Just pass this high-level view to Kelda’s deployment platform using the Kelda CLI, and we take care of the nitty gritty details needed to get your system up and running in your cloud of choice.

    Oh, and Kelda isn’t all-or-nothing - we run great alongside any existing services you might have.
